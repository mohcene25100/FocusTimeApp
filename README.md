# Component Folder
it contains global components that can be used across all the application, kind of reusable like Buttons.

# Features Folder
Sometimes called the Screens, and because we don't have really big app it is suitable to call it features that encapsulate the screens that we're building.

# Utils Folder
Utilities is always available to enrich a feature, to encapsulate certain parts that we need to reuse in multiple spots.
